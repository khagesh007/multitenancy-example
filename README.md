# Multitenancy in Laravel
This fork is taken from themsaid/multitenancy-example, which is based on mysql databse. I have tried to make it for PostgresSql which provide better (What I understand currently) schema for multi tenancy app.

You can watch the video on the making of this example on https://youtu.be/592EgykFOz4

# Goals
Complete multi tenancy application in laravel with PostgreSQL database.
